Code for the paper **Expectation consistency for calibration of neural networks**

* File `main.py` is used to train models for datasets SVHN and CIFAR10

* The code to compute Expectation Consistency and Temperature Scaling are respectively `find_optimal_temperature_expectation_consistency` and `find_optimal_temperature_expectation_consistency`,
in the file `comparison.py`.
